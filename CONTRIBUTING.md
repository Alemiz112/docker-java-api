## Contributing rules:

1. Small PRs! Ideally max. 5 changed files. You shouldn't spend more than 30min on it.
2. Stay object oriented! Try to understand the library's architecture before you do anything. 
3. No code changes without at least one type of test (unit test or integration tests).
4. No PRs will be accepted if they don't pass the CI build, influding the Checkstyle rules.
